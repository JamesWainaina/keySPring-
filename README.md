# KeySpring - Keycloak Integration with Spring Boot

## Project Overview

**KeySpring** is a Spring Boot-based application that integrates with **Keycloak** to provide secure, robust, and easy-to-manage authentication and authorization for users. This project demonstrates how to use Keycloak for identity and access management in a Spring Boot application, covering configuration, integration, and usage of OAuth2 and OpenID Connect protocols for seamless security management.

## Features

- **Keycloak Integration**: Secure user authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) with Keycloak.
- **OAuth2/OpenID Connect**: Leverage OAuth2 and OIDC for standardized, secure communication.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Enforce access control based on user roles defined in Keycloak.
- **Spring Boot**: Built using the powerful Spring Boot framework for a fast, scalable, and modular solution.
- **REST API Security**: Protect REST endpoints using Keycloak authorization.
- **Configurable Security**: Easily configure Keycloak using Spring Boot's configuration properties.

## Tech Stack

- **Spring Boot** - Backend framework for Java applications.
- **Keycloak** - Open-source identity and access management system.
- **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** - Authentication and authorization protocols.
- **Maven** - Build and dependency management tool.
- **Spring Security** - For securing the Spring Boot application.
- **REST APIs** - Secure and protected endpoints using Keycloak.
